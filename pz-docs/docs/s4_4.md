## S4.4 - PZ Tables as Federated Datasets 

During its ten years of operations, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide photometric measurements for billions of objects. Most of the foreseen LSST science cases will rely on photometric redshifts (photo-z) estimates for these objects. 

The LSST project plan to provide at least one, possibly more, photo-z estimates for each object as part of each data release. Given the large and diverse scope of science that can result from the LSST data, a unique photo-z method is expected to not satisfy all the requirements of the whole community. 

As part of the BRA-LIN in-kind contribution program, this contribution consists in offering photo-z tables as federated datasets for each data release, using a different photo-z method from the official estimates (to be defined by the DM team), thus expanding the scope of the science supported by the data releases. 

The infrastructure required to produce, store, and deliver the photo-z tables will be provided by the Brazilian IDAC. The software development necessary to produce these tables, which include the optimization and refactoring of the DES photo-z pipelines to run on the LSST scale and the production of new pipelines to cover all steps of the data flow, is accounted for as a directable software development effort.
