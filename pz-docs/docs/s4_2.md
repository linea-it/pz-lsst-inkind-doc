## S4.2 - PZ Server 

 Inspired by features of the DES Science Portal ([Gschwend et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213133718300891?via%3Dihub); [Fausti Neto et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213133717300975)), the PZ Server is being planned to be an online service, complementary to the Rubin Science Platform (RSP), to host PZ-related lightweight data products and to offer data management tools that allow sharing data products among RSP users, attach and share relevant metadata, and help on provenance tracking. 
 
The PZ Server will be hosted in the Brazilian Independent Data Access Center (IDAC), being accessible via an independent URL (www.linea.gov.br/pz-server), open to all RSP users (LSST data rights holders), without geographic constraints. It is planned to be as broad and generic as possible to be useful to all LSST Science Collaborations working with PZ data products. As required by LSST in-kind program, the source code will be publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/linea-it/pz-server).

The PZ Coordination Group will receive "admin" user credentials with special permissions. It will also be able to request uploads of official data products on-demand to the LIneA team.
The PZ Server is being designed with a special focus on helping RSP users participating in the PZ Validation Cooperative, a DM team's initiative that will take place during LSST commissioning phase (see technical note dmtn-049 for details), but it is planned to continue serving the LSST Community during subsequent years. During the PZ Validation Cooperative, the PZ Coordination Group will be able to use the PZ Server to host and distribute standardized training and validation sets to be used in algorithm performance comparison experiments and to collect the results obtained by different users. 

Beyond the PZ Validation Cooperative, the RSP users can use the PZ Server to easily keep track and share lightweight files containing varied test results. However, all data products uploaded to the PZ Server will automatically be visible and available, without any scientific validation, to all RSP users and only for this particular group. Therefore it is not the appropriate tool to release data products to the general public.
