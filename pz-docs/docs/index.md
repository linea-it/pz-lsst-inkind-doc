# BRA-LIN-S4     

In-kind contribution program BRA-LIN-S4 - Photometric Redshifts.

#### Introduction

This page describes the in-kind contributions offered by the Laboratório Interinstitucional de e-Astronomia ([LIneA](http://www.linea.org.br)) to [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org/)'s PZ Coordination Group, approved as part of the in-kind contribution program BRA-LIN. The BRA-LIN in-kind contribution proposal document is available on [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JWUG2vxxPD1DwrbQsZwI1q_2lk2TIGnHGHNbaq2zAbk/edit?usp=sharing). 

This is a live document started with the description of planned work, to be constantly updated to offer a high-level description of the software produced, as long as the program evolves. Technical documentation of each piece of software should be delivered together with the code in the respective repositories.
